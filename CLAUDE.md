## Architecture

**Event-sourcing pattern.** `Tortoise` accumulates `[TortoiseCommand]` (never mutates past state). Renderers are pure functions that consume the same stream:

```
Tortoise API → [TortoiseCommand] → CommandPlayer.play() → [PlaybackFrame]
                                                               ↓
                                               TortoiseUI  (animation)
                                               TortoiseSVG (SVG string)
```

**Module dependency rule:** `TortoiseCore` has no platform dependencies (Foundation only). `TortoiseUI` and `TortoiseSVG` both depend on `TortoiseCore` and never on each other.

**Linux support:** `TortoiseCore` and `TortoiseSVG` build and pass all tests on Linux — do not introduce Apple-only APIs into them (the CI `linux` job enforces this). `Package.swift` omits the SwiftUI-based `TortoiseUI` product and targets on Linux via `#if !os(Linux)` (a manifest `#if os()` evaluates on the build host), so plain `swift build` / `swift test` work there.

**Examples target layout is load-bearing (#31).** The gallery drawings live in the `ExamplesGallery` *library* target at `Sources/Examples/Gallery/`, with `ExamplesRunner` (executable, `Sources/Examples/Runner/`) regenerating `docs/examples/*.svg` from the same code. Do not fold the drawings back into the executable or move them out of `Sources/`: Xcode refuses to preview executable targets without `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB`, which SwiftPM cannot set, and both targets must stay exposed as products for previews to work. `Gallery.drawings` lists the examples in README order — add new examples there too, or the runner won't emit their SVG.

## Key Design Decisions

**`@MainActor @Observable` on `Tortoise` and `CanvasModel`.** `Tortoise` is always created and used on the main actor. `CanvasModel` is internal to `TortoiseUI` and also main-actor-bound.

**`nonisolated static func` for arc math.** `Tortoise.arcCenter()` and `Tortoise.arcEndState()` are pure math helpers shared between `Tortoise` (main-actor) and `CommandPlayer` (non-isolated). They must stay `nonisolated static` — do not add state access to them.

**`TortoiseState.applying(_:)` is the single state-transition reducer.** `Tortoise` applies each command as it records it (via its private `record(_:)`), and `CommandPlayer` replays streams through the same function — never reimplement position/heading/pen state math on either side. The player's switch only derives drawing output (strokes, fills, dots) from the before/after states. `StateConsistencyTests` guards this with a random-program comparison.

**`@MainActor init` + `State(wrappedValue:)` in `TortoiseCanvas`.** This is an intentional violation of the swiftui_way.md rule against assigning `@State` in `init`. It's required so instant-mode programs are visible in static Xcode Previews (where `TimelineView` never fires).

**`TortoiseChangeKey` (instance identity + `Tortoise.mutationCount`) is the change-detection key.** `TortoiseCanvas` watches `task(id: TortoiseChangeKey(tortoise))` — not `commands.count` — because `reset()` followed by re-recording the same number of commands leaves the count unchanged, and swapping in a different `Tortoise` instance can leave even `mutationCount` unchanged; the composite key catches both. The counter (package-level, no public API) increments on every `record(_:)` and on `reset()`; `CanvasModel.sourceKey` remembers what the model was built from so the guard can skip the initial task firing.

**Sub-frame animation via `animationProgress`.** `CanvasModel` exposes `animationProgress: Double` (0→1) and `inProgressFrame: PlaybackFrame?`. `TortoiseCanvas` uses these to interpolate tortoise position/heading and draw partial strokes, so the tortoise visibly walks as it draws. Do not collapse this back to per-frame snapping.

**`CanvasModel.liveTortoiseState` is the only place that blend happens.** `CanvasRenderer.drawTortoise` takes an already-interpolated state rather than a pair to blend, and `TortoisePlayer.currentTortoiseState` hands back the same value — so a caller drawing its own tortoise is drawing where the built-in sprite would be, and cannot drift a fraction of a command away from it. The blend itself is `TortoiseState.interpolated(toward:progress:)`, in Core beside `applying(_:)` and for the same reason. **Only position and heading move**: a pen goes down *at* a command, not across one, so interpolating `isPenDown` or a color would invent a state the program never had. Don't reintroduce a second interpolation at a draw site.

**`TortoiseSprite.hidden` is not `hideTortoise()`,** and that is the distinction a user will get wrong. The command is part of the *drawing* — it serializes, and every renderer honors it. The sprite case is a property of one *view*, and changing it cannot change the drawing. `TortoiseState.isVisible` still reflects the command, so a custom cursor must honor it itself; the canvas checks both. `halfExtent` is 0 for `.hidden`, so `autoFit` insets by nothing and the drawing runs edge to edge — intended (there is no sprite to keep clear of the edge), and the answer when a caller asks where its margin went.

**Two-layer rendering in `TortoiseCanvas` (#35).** Committed elements draw in `CommittedLayer`, a `Canvas` *outside* the `TimelineView`; only the in-progress stroke/arc and the tortoise sprite (`AnimationLayer`) render at display refresh rate. Do not move committed-element drawing back inside the `TimelineView` — that is O(elements) Path-building per display frame and stutters at a few hundred commands. `CommittedLayer` reads `model.elements` / `backgroundColor` during *body* evaluation (snapshotted into the Canvas closure) so Observation invalidates it exactly on frame commits and step/seek/clear — keep those reads at body level rather than relying on tracking inside the Canvas rendering closure. Drawing primitives shared by both layers live in `CanvasRenderer`.

**Stroke batching in `CanvasRenderer.drawElements` (#37).** A maximal run of consecutive `.stroke` elements sharing `color` and `width` is merged into one multi-subpath `Path` and drawn with a single `ctx.stroke` — the per-element `Path` + draw-call overhead (~0.37µs) dominates committed-layer redraw, not rasterization, so this is ~6× at 10,000 strokes. Round caps apply per subpath, so the output is unchanged. Two invariants to preserve: **translucent strokes (`color.alpha < 1`) must not be batched** — overlapping segments have to blend once per stroke to match the SVG renderer's one `<line>` per stroke (`translucentOverlaps` scenario guards this) — and **`.fill` / `.arcStroke` / `.dot` are never batched**, so element order and z-order (and therefore `fillInsertionIndex`) are untouched. Batching does change antialiasing where strokes overlap (one rasterization instead of two blends), which is why the canvas goldens were re-recorded.

**`isFillActive` on `PlaybackFrame`.** Added so SVG and other renderers can defer stroke emission until after `endFill`, placing the fill polygon below its outline strokes. `CommandPlayer` snapshots `fillPoints != nil` at the start of each command iteration to set this flag.

**`[DrawElement]` + `fillInsertionIndex` in `CanvasModel`.** Drawing elements are stored as a single ordered `[DrawElement]` list (not separate arrays per type) to preserve command-execution order. Strokes/dots emitted while `isFillActive` are appended immediately (so they animate live during the fill); `fillInsertionIndex` records the `elements.count` at the moment the fill became active, and on `endFill` the fill polygon is `insert`ed at that index — so it renders below its outline strokes regardless of command order, without delaying those strokes' own appearance.

**`DrawingBounds` computed at init.** `CanvasModel.drawingBounds` is an axis-aligned bounding box of all visible output across all frames, computed once in `init` (not per-tick). Arcs use the full-circle bounding box (center ± radius) — conservative but always correct, and avoids trigonometry over partial arc segments. `ViewportMode.autoFit` consumes this to scale and center the view; it falls back to `.scaleToFit` when `drawingBounds` is `nil` (no visible output). The `transform()` method signature takes `drawingBounds: DrawingBounds?` as a parameter so `TortoiseCanvas` passes the model's precomputed value. `DrawingBounds` lives in `TortoiseCore` (not `TortoiseUI`) because `TortoiseSVG` consumes the same computation for `render(_:fit:)` / `svg(fit:)`, which crop the `viewBox` to the drawing (default `fit: true`); `fit: false` keeps the full logical `canvasSize`.

**Hand-written `Codable` with a frozen wire format.** `Codable.swift` implements every conformance manually with explicit coding keys — do not replace it with synthesized conformances, and do not rename a key to match a refactored Swift identifier. The JSON format is **frozen for the 2.x series** (documented in `Sources/TortoiseCore/Documentation.docc/CommandSerialization.md`, which must be updated alongside any format change), because command streams are meant to be persisted as app documents and golden files. A command encodes as an object with exactly one key, the command name; decoding rejects zero keys, several keys, or an unknown key, while unknown fields *inside* a payload are ignored so payloads can grow compatibly. Adding a new `TortoiseCommand` case is backward compatible (old data still decodes); changing or removing an existing key is not.

**`@_exported import TortoiseCore` in `TortoiseUI` and `TortoiseSVG`.** Users only write `import TortoiseUI` / `import TortoiseSVG` and still see all Core types. The underscored attribute has no stability guarantee from Swift; if a future toolchain breaks it, the fallback is to drop the re-export and require users to add `import TortoiseCore` themselves — a breaking change to document in the CHANGELOG, not something to work around with tricks.

**`Color.defaultBackground` is the single source of truth for the initial background (#44).** `Tortoise` starts at it, `CommandPlayer.play`'s `initialBackgroundColor` defaults to it, and `CanvasModel` / `SVGBuilder` use it as their empty-stream fallback. It is white. Renderers must never substitute a fallback of their own: they previously started from `.clear` while `Tortoise.backgroundColor` reported white, so a program that issued no `.backgroundColor` command painted nothing — the tortoise and its own drawing disagreed about the color of the paper. Note that `Tortoise.backgroundColor` is the *current* value, not the initial one, so it must not be threaded in as `initialBackgroundColor`; that would back-date a later background change to frame 0. Transparency is still available, but must be asked for: `tortoise.backgroundColor = .clear`. Both renderers still skip the fill / omit the `<rect>` when `alpha == 0`, which is what makes SwiftUI's `.background()` modifier work.

**Pen-width taper is a primitive, not sugar (`taperedForward` / `taperedArc`).** `forward(_:widthTo:)` and `circle(radius:extent:widthTo:)` each record *one* command. The tempting alternative — subdividing the move into short constant-width segments emitting ordinary `.penWidth` + `.forward` pairs — needs no renderer changes at all, and is wrong. In this library the unit of *time* is the command: `CommandPlayer` emits a frame per command including state-only ones, and `stepDuration` is distance-independent, so an expansion-based taper buys width fidelity with animation time. `forward(280, widthTo: 12)` from width 1 costs 89 commands, 44 SVG `<line>` elements and 8.9 s at the default speed, and its sub-segments' round caps blend twice at every seam when `alpha < 1`. As one command it is one frame, one element, and one blended region. Do not "optimize" this back into an expansion, and do not add a `steps:` parameter — there is nothing to subdivide.

**`StrokeOutline` is the single source of taper geometry.** A varying width cannot be stroked, so both renderers *fill* the region the pen sweeps, and both fill the identical polygon from Core — that is the whole reason the math lives there rather than in either renderer. Straight strokes are exact: the outline is the convex hull of the two end discs, whose sides are the discs' external tangents (`sinA = (r0 - r1)/d`), *not* the endpoints offset along the perpendicular — the cheap version leaves a notch where each side meets its cap. Arc edges (`radius ∓ width(t)/2`) are spirals and get flattened to a sagitta tolerance, bounded at `maxSegments`. SVG deliberately uses these flattened points rather than its own arc commands: exact `<path>` caps would look marginally better in isolation and would let the two renderers drift apart. Two consequences to preserve: **tapered strokes must never join the same-width batching** in `CanvasRenderer.drawElements` (`Stroke.width` is only the *start* width, so a taper can compare equal to an untapered run and be silently drawn as a plain line), and **the in-progress stroke truncates its width ramp along with its spine**, or the mark changes width behind the tortoise as the frame finishes.

**`TortoiseSprite` is a TortoiseUI-only concept.** The sprite (built-in triangle or a user `Image`) is chosen through the `\.tortoiseSprite` environment value, like `\.tortoiseViewport` — it is *not* a `TortoiseCommand`, so it never enters the serialized stream and `TortoiseSVG` is unaffected (SVG output has never drawn the tortoise). Both canvas layers read the environment value even though only `AnimationLayer` draws the sprite: `ViewportMode.autoFit`'s edge inset is `TortoiseSprite.halfExtent * tortoiseScaleMax`, and the two layers must derive the identical transform. `halfExtent` is the sprite's half-*diagonal* so the inset holds at every heading. Image sprites are aspect-fitted into `size` (`ctx.resolve` gives the intrinsic size; a `ResolvedImage` is bound to its context, so this cannot be hoisted out of the per-frame draw).

## Coordinate System

- **Tortoise space**: center origin, Y-up, heading 0 = north, clockwise positive. Arc angles: 0 = east, CCW positive (standard math).
- **SVG / screen space**: top-left origin, Y-down.
- **Transform** (tortoise → SVG): `svg_x = w/2 + tortoise_x`, `svg_y = h/2 - tortoise_y`
- **Arc sweep-flag in SVG**: tortoise CCW (positive sweep) = CW in SVG (Y-flipped) = `sweep-flag 1`.

## Instant Mode

`isInstantMode(frames:)` in `CanvasModel` returns `true` if any frame with `tortoiseState.speed ≤ 0` appears before the first frame that produces visible output (stroke/arc/fill). When true, `CanvasModel.init` eagerly flushes all frames so static Xcode Previews show the full drawing.

## Testing

Tests live in `Tests/TortoiseCoreTests/`, `Tests/TortoiseSVGTests/`, and `Tests/TortoiseUITests/`. Tests use swift-testing (`@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`). `Tortoise` is `@MainActor` so test suites that use it are marked `@MainActor`.

`CodableTests.swift` pins the JSON wire format with literal expected strings — a failure there means the persisted format changed, which is a breaking change, not a test to re-baseline.

SVG tests avoid raw string literals (`#"..."#`) when the expected string contains `"#` (e.g. hex colors) — use regular strings with escaped quotes instead: `"fill=\"#ff0000\""`.

**Drawing-scenario golden tests.** `Tests/TortoiseTestSupport/` (a non-product target) defines `DrawingScenario.all` — feature-grouped tortoise programs that together cover every `TortoiseCommand` case. Both renderers are verified against the same scenarios via pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing:

- `TortoiseSVGTests/DrawingScenarioSVGTests` compares full SVG strings against goldens in `Tests/TortoiseSVGTests/__Snapshots__/`.
- `TortoiseUITests/DrawingScenarioCanvasTests` (macOS-only, `#if os(macOS)`) renders `TortoiseCanvas` via `ImageRenderer` (`scale = 2`, instant mode forced by prepending `speed = 0`) and compares PNGs in `Tests/TortoiseUITests/__Snapshots__/` with `.canvasGolden` (byte-wise `precision: 0.995`, defined in `CanvasGoldenSnapshotting.swift`) to absorb OS-level antialiasing drift. **Do not add `perceptualPrecision`**: swift-snapshot-testing's perceptual path passes a bare `CGRect` to `CIAreaAverage`, which Core Image on macOS 27 rejects with an uncaught exception that kills the whole test process. It only triggers when bytes differ, so it passes on the recording macOS and crashes on the CI runner's. Tracked in #49 (still reproduces on Xcode 27.0 GA; re-check once the runner image ships a GA macOS 27).

After intentionally changing scenario programs or renderer output, re-record **both** golden sets in the same commit and visually inspect them:

```bash
SNAPSHOT_TESTING_RECORD=all swift test --filter DrawingScenario
```
